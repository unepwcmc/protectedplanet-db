	<strong>To enquire about updating data in the WDPA please contact protectedareas@unep-wcmc.org </strong>
</p>
<p>
	 The WDPA is a partnership not only between UN Environment and IUCN, but also with all the data providers that supply data to the WDPA. These data providers are primarily government agencies but are often NGOs who frequently support g<span>overnment agencies in managing their protected areas dataset. As of April 2016, WDPA contains data from 245 countries and territories and this data is supplied from over 530 sources.  </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span>We aim to ensure that data is updated at a minimum every 5 years. Since the start of 2015 71</span><span>% of the data has been either added or verified by data. In all 87% of data has been updated within the last 5 years.  However, 12% of data has not been updated in over 10 years, and in these cases we are looking at ways to work more closely with countries to see how we can assist (all figures based on the April 2016 version of the WDPA).  </span></p><p><img rel="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="" src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/030/original/Percentageupdated50percent.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p><p><br></p><p>Figure by UNEP-WCMC; <span>Source: UNEP-WCMC <span>and <span>IUCN</span> (2016), Protected Planet: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [On-line], [April 2016], Cambridge, UK: <span>UNEP-WCMC</span> <span>and</span> <span>IUCN</span>.
