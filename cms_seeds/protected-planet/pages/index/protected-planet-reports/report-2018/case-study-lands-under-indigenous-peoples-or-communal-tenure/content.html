<div> <p><span><strong></strong>Although OECMs can be under the control of a range of governance actors, lands and waters under the governance of indigenous peoples and local communities may often be good candidates to meet the definition. OECMs could therefore potentially provide a good opportunity to increase recognition and support for territories and areas conserved by indigenous peoples and local communities (also known as ICCAs) (CBD, 2018). Indigenous peoples have use or management rights over one quarter of the world's land area (Garnett at al., 2018). Indigenous peoples manage these lands in diverse ways and in pursuit of diverse outcomes but in many cases indigenous peoples' management of their lands may often be consistent with biodiversity conservation. ICCAs are widely accepted as places of high conservation and cultural value, contributing to connectivity and landscape-scale conservation (Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2012). Many such areas meet the definition of a protected area or an OECM, but are currently under-reported in the WDPA. A dedicated database, the <a href="http://www.iccaregistry.org/" target="_blank">Global ICCA Registry</a>, exists to capture information on ICCAs provided by indigenous peoples and local communities. </span><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/178/original/PPLIVE2018_Box14_fg1.png" alt="Pplive2018 Box14 Fg1" style="width: 552px; height: 280.805px;" rel="width: 552px; height: 280.805px;"></p><p><b><i>Percentage of lands managed and/or controlled by indigenous peoples*</i></b></p><div> <div> <p>Source: Garnett S.T., Burgess N.D., Fa J.E. et al. 2018.
