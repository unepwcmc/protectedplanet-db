<p>
	<span>The Protected Planet Report uses the April 2016 release of the World Database on Protected Areas.</span><span>A total of 217,155 designated protected areas from 244 countries and territories were included </span><span>(202,467 terrestrial and 14,688 marine). These include all protected areas designated at a national level, those </span><span>under regional agreements (e.g. Natura 2000 network), and those under regional and international conventions </span><span>or agreements (e.g Natural World Heritage sites).</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span></span><span>A total of 6,797 sites were excluded from the analyses. These </span><span>included UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserves (583 sites), protected areas with a status of “proposed" </span><span>(2,347 sites) or “not reported" (236 sites), and 3,631 sites reported as points without an associated area. </span><span>UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserves (MAB reserves) were removed on the basis that their buffer areas </span><span>and transition zones may not comply with the IUCN protected area definition. Moreover, most core areas of </span><span>MAB reserves overlap with existing protected areas. The WDPA is constantly updated as new information and </span><span>corrections are incorporated, but since this is a dynamic process, it can never be considered to be completely up </span><span>to date. Nevertheless, since 2014, 85% of the database has been updated, and the aim is to update countries </span><span>and territories at least every five years and to make concerted efforts to complete data holdings where these are </span><span>deficient. </span>
</p>
<p>
	All area calculations on coverage remove overlaps between protected areas (as a result 
	<span>of multiple designations) to avoid double counting. For those protected areas reported in the WDPA as points but </span><span>which include an area, a buffer equal to the Reported Area was created and used in the analysis. To calculate the </span><span>total area of the protected area estate in different years the field in the WDPA called Status Year was used. Status </span><span>Year refers to the year a specific protected area was designated. Sites that no longer have protected area status </span><span>are not stored in the WDPA.</span>
