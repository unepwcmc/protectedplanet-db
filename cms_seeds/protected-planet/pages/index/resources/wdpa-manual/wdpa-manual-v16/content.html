<p>The User Manual provides information and guidance about the data held within the WDPA, including its history, how it is collected, managed and distributed, and how it should be interpreted and used for analyses and research.</p><p>The Manual has been prepared for WDPA data providers and users. It is structured in 5 sections and includes 6 appendices. The User Manual is a dynamic and evolving document. It is recommended that all parties interested in using the WDPA read these guidelines prior to using the WDPA for any analyses that will inform research or decision making. For any queries regarding collation, use, processing of the database, or any feedback regarding this manual please contact <a href="https://unep-wcmc.codebasehq.com/redirect?protectedareas@unep-wcmc.org" target="_blank"><u>protectedareas@unep-wcmc.org</u></a>. </p><p>Manual 1.6 (now titled User manual for the World Database on Protected Areas and world database on other effective area-based conservation measures) has been updated to reflect UNEP-WCMC's word on developing a parallel database to the WDPA, the WD-OECM. This new database stores data on 'other effective area-based conservation measures' as defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity. The text has also been updated to reflect changes in the MARINE and NO_TAKE fields, and section 5.5 on using the WDPA and WD-OECM for analyses has been revised. All appendices have been updated, and the text has been edited throughout for improved clarity.</p><p>As of September 2019, version 1.6 of the manual is available in English only. Translated versions of this updated manual in French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese will be made available soon.</p><strong></strong><a href="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/203/original/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf" target="_blank">Read/Download in English</a><br>
