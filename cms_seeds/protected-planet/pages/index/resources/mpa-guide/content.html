<p>Momentum to protect the global ocean and to use Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a conservation tool is greater than it has ever been. But realizing the potential will require a common, shared language to understand, track and celebrate achievements and provide clarity about our collective, science-based goals.</p><p>The MPA Guide refines existing language and captures a shared vision to describe MPAs and the conservation outcomes they provide. It is the work of hundreds of stakeholders from around the world. It is a timely and important tool to help drive more and better ocean protection and reflects a collective ambition to find unity in language and consistency in approach.</p><p>Download the MPA Guide here:</p><p><a href="http://www.wcmc.io/MPA_Guide_EN">English</a></p><p><a href="http://wcmc.io/MPA_guide_FR" target="_blank">French</a></p><p><a href="http://wcmc.io/MPA_guide_ES" target="_blank">Spanish</a></p><p><a href="http://wcmc.io/MPA_guide_CH" target="_blank">Mandarin</a></p><p>For more information please contact: TheMPAguide@gmail.com.</p>
