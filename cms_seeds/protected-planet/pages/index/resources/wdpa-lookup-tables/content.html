	The WDPA has multiple fields which contain a series of accepted values. These fields can be found below:
</p>
<h2 id="IUCN Management Categories">IUCN Management Categories</h2>
<p>
	<br>
	IUCN protected area management categories classify protected areas according to their management objectives.

  Ia
	</td>
	<td>
  Category Ia are
  strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly
  geological/geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts
  are strictly controlled and limited to ensure protection of the conservation
  values. Such protected areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for
  scientific research and monitoring.

  Category Ib
  protected areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas,
  retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or
  significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to
  preserve their natural condition.

  II

  Category II
  protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect
  large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species
  an  ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a
  foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual,
  scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities.
	</td>

	<td>
  III
	</td>
	<td>
  Category III
  protected areas are set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which
  can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a
  cave or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally
  quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
  IV
	</td>
	<td>
  Category IV
  protected areas aim to protect particular species or habitats and management
  reflects this priority. Many category IV protected areas will need regular,
  active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to
  maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of the category.
	</td>

	<td>
  V
	</td>
	<td>
   A protected area where the interaction of
  people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with
  significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value: and where
  safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and
  sustaining the area and its associated nature conservation and other values
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
  VI
	</td>
	<td>
  Category VI
  protected areas conserve ecosystems and habitats, together with associated
  cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. They are
  generally large, with most of the area in a natural condition, where a
  proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where
  low-level non-industrial use of natural resources compatible with nature
  conservation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.

<h2 id="Marine realm">Marine realm</h2>
<p>
	<strong></strong><br>
	This field describes whether a protected area falls totally or partially, within the marine environment. Protected areas classified as marine within the WDPA can be either completely marine – in a sea, ocean or equivalent – or partially marine – on the coast and intertidal/encompassing part of the sea/ocean. Protected areas encompassing brackish or tidal waters may be classified as marine, but freshwaters areas should not be classified as marine.

<h2 id="No Take"> No Take</h2>
<p>
	<strong></strong><br>
	No take means that the taking of living or dead natural resources, inclusive of all methods of fishing, extraction, dumping, dredging and construction, is strictly prohibited in all or part of a marine protected area. This is only applicable to protected areas where the field marine = 1 or 2. The objective of a protected area which is no-take is the preservation of the biodiversity and other natural resources and to act as a strictly protected area. No-take zones are also commonly designated within multiple-use marine protected areas.

<h2 id="Status">Status</h2>
<p>
	<strong></strong><br>
	All protected areas in the WDPA are either listed as 'Designated', 'Proposed' or 'Established'. Protected areas that have been degazetted are not included within the WDPA. Degazetted areas are those protected areas that are no longer legally protected or recognised, and hence the protected area no longer exists administratively. The status year is the year that the current status of the protected came into force, i.e. the year that it was proposed as a protected area, or the year it was designated as a protected area.

<h2 id="Governance Type">Governance Type</h2>
<p>
	<strong></strong><br>
	Governance is a description of the decision-making structure of a protected area and should describe where the decision-making power of delegating management authority rests. The information provided on governance conforms to the IUCN Governance types described in the 
	<a href="https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_assignment_1.pdf">IUCN Governance of Protected Areas guidelines</a>. IUCN distinguishes four broad protected area governance types, each with several sub-types (see table below) making a total of 11 types that can be reported to the WDPA.
