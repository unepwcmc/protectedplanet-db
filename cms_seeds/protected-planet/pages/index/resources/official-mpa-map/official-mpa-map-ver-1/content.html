<p>In order to evaluate progress towards achieving the global targets in the marine environment the <a href="http://stage.protectedplanet.net/c/world-database-on-protected-areas">WDPA </a>is used to track the rate of change via the <a href="http://stage.protectedplanet.net/c/protected-planet-reports">Protected Planet Reports</a>, the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300">SDG </a>process as well as several academic publications see for example "Evaluating official marine protected area coverage for Aichi Target 11: appraising the data and methods that define our progress, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aqc.2511/abstract">Thomas et al. 2014</a>). The progress in growth in the MPA network, resulting from a combination of new sites being created,existing sites being expanded and a number of large sites being announced, will contribute even more to an increase in the total protected area coverage. An important tool in tracking the continued evolution of the global MPA network is the "Official MPA map" series developed in conjunction with IUCN which utilises versions of the WDPA to highlight progress in reaching the global targets.</p>

<p>
	The first "Official MPA map" was produced in October 2013 at <a href="http://www.impac3.org/en/">IMPAC 3</a> is available <a href="http://wcmc.io/Official_MPA_map_Oct2013">here</a>.</p><p>
