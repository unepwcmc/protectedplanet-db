Highlights:
Bermuda: Complete update, resulting in the conversion of all seven points to polygons. Additionally, 100 protected area records were removed by the national data provider following a government-led re-evaluation of the alignment of records with the IUCN definition of a protected area.

Gabon: Partial update, resulting in the addition of 29 marine protected areas records, all with defined boundaries and representing a total of 54,340 kmÂ². The sites have been newly designated since June 2017, and management plans are under development by the national government agency (Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux).

Cook Islands: Partial update, including the addition of the 1.97 million km2 Marae Moana Marine Park marine protected area. The Marine Park was designated in July 2017 and encompasses the entire Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone. Marae Moana is now the largest protected area in the world.

Ramsar Sites, Wetlands of International Importance: Partial update to Ramsar sites across eight countries, including the addition of 14 records for Brazil, France, Madagascar, Malawi and Myanmar, and 10 updated records for Bermuda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the French Southern Territories. This update is part of a series of updates on Ramsar data within the WDPA, resulting from enhanced data flows between UNEP-WCMC, the Ramsar Secretariat and member states.
