This manual has been developed to support custodians of ICCAs in providing data to the ICCA Registry and WDPA. It is aimed at indigenous peoples, local communities, and those who work with them. The first section provides ICCA custodians with the information they need in order to collectively decide whether to participate. For those who wish to provide information, the second half of the manual describes how to do so and what to expect afterwards.<br></p><p>Download the <a href="http://wcmc.io/iccadatamanual">ICCA Data Manual</a></p>
