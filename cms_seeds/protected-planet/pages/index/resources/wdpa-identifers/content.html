	The Word Database on Protected Areas uses two identifiers to record protected areas data. The first is the WDPA_ID which is the unique identifier of a protected area and the second is the WDPA_PID or Parcel Identifier which is the unique identifier of any parcels within a given protected area.</p><p><strong>The WDPA PID is unique to each record in the WDPA, while the WDPA ID is unique to each protected area. </strong><br>
</p>
<h4>WDPA ID: </h4>
<p>
	The WDPA Identifier (WDPA_ID) is  a globally unique and persistent identifier for a protected area. The WDPA ID is not unique to the geography of a protected area but to the designation of the protected area. For example, a lake and its shoreline can be a Nature Reserve under a national designation but also an international Ramsar site under the Ramsar convention. This means that for the same place the WDPA will record two WDPA_IDs: one for the national site and another one for the international site.</p>
<h4>WDPA PID: </h4>
<p>
Parcel ID's are used when in the same protected area different zones have been formally defined and delineated by the data provider e.g. different IUCN management categories. </p>
<p>
	In the <a href="/c/monthly-updates/2016/november-update-of-the-wdpa">November 2016 release</a> of the WDPA a change was made to the structure of the WDPA Parcel ID (WDPA_PID) field in order to link the parcels to the parent WDPA_ID. The Parcel Identifier will be based upon the WDPA ID for that site with an additional parcel letter added to the code.
</p>
<h3>Example: </h3>
<p>
	The Mexican site <a href="https://protectedplanet.net/101412">Archipi√©lago de Revillagigedo</a> which has the WDPA_ID of 101412 has two parcels associated with it: parcel 101412_A and parcel 101412_B. The structure of the parcel ids is as follows:
