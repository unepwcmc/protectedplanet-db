The total number of protected area records in the July 2020 release of the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is 255,665 comprising 234,580 polygons and 21,085 points, covering 245 countries and territories.

July 2020 also sees another release of the World Database on other effective area-based conservation measures (WD-OECM). The WD-OECM can be combined with the WDPA to reveal how measures beyond protected areas contribute to conservation networks. It can be downloaded here.

Highlights:
Cambodia: This is a complete update for Cambodia's national sites, the first since 2010. It includes 40 new protected areas: six newly designated National Parks - 2 of them (Central Kravanh and Southern Kravanh) covering more than 4,000 km2 each; twelve Wildlife Sanctuaries; two Natural Heritage Parks; eleven Protected Landscapes; five Multiple Use Areas and three Biodiversity Corridor of Protected Areas. This update is a result of the good collaboration between UNEP-WCMC and the Department of Geospatial Information Services (DGIS) at Ministry of Environment (MOE) in Cambodia.

New Zealand: This is an important addition of nearly 4,700 privately protected areas in New Zealand, reflecting our efforts to improve the representation of non-state protected areas in the WDPA. The Queen Elizabeth II National Trust (QEII) worked over the last year to format their data according to the WDPA standards, and New Zealandâ€™s Department of Conservation verified the data so that it could be included in the WDPA. Read our blog post about the update here!

Solomon Islands: Addition of two newly-designated sites in Solomon Islands. Both are forest conservation areas managed by local communities. This update was facilitated by the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, supported by the BIOPAMA programme.]

United States of America: This PAD-US 2.0 WDPA submission update includes over 38,000 unique protected areas representing more than 5.5 million km2 (including overlapping designations) primarily managed for biodiversity protection. Total protected area decreased by about 1.4 million km2 when compared to the WDPA update from PAD-US 1.4. This decrease largely reflects changes in conservation measure assignments for easements and marine areas following major revisions to the NOAA MPA Inventory and National Conservation Easement Database, the sole source of marine protected areas and easement data in PAD-US, respectively. Many changes also reflect refinements in Designation Type and Unit Name provided by data-stewards that resulted in a reduction of about 10,000 existing sites in the WDPA. Federal agencies, especially the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), contributed the vast majority of new area nearly 500,000 km2; however, this is largely a result of a more complete accounting of all designations for a particular place. For example, the WDPA 2.0 includes significantly overlapping areas such as Marianas Trench Marine National Monument and Mariana Trench National Wildlife Refuge, both provided by FWS for PAD-US, in addition to the Mariana Trench Marine Protected Area provided by NOAA. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (NPS), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) also added about 160,000 km2 of designated protected areas (including MPAs that overlap other agency designations) between the PAD-US 1.4 and 2.0 updates for the WDPA.

El Salvador: This is a complete update for El Salvador national sites, the first since 2011. It includes a full verification of all existing sites, and the addition of 64 new national protected areas (most of them designated as 'Natural Protected Areas').

Uzbekistan: This is a complete update for Uzbekistan national sites, the first since 1997. This update includes 21 new protected areas: the Durman National Park; six State Natural Monuments; ten State Wildlife Sanctuaries; two State Biosphere Reserves; one Natural Nursery and a State Complex (Landscape) Reserve. This update was made possible through the collaboration between UNEP-WCMC, IUCN and the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Ecology and Environmental Protection amongst others.
