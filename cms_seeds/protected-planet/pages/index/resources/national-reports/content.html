<p>The Protected Planet Report series helps track international progress towards achieving global biodiversity targets; however, in 2016 a new series of reports was created focusing at the national scale. This new type of report, the first in the 'Protected Planet National Technical Series',  aims to support decisions on protected area expansion at the national scale by assessing progress towards global biodiversity targets, while also aiming to inform implementation of national targets..</p><p><strong>2016</strong><br></p><p><strong>Protected Planet Report National Technical Series: Republic of Korea </strong><br></p><p>The aim of the report is to assess the status of the protected area network of the Republic of Korea and propose priorities for expansion to support the implementation of international and national biodiversity targets. The Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) framework was followed to design the analysis. Its goal is to develop cost effective networks of protected areas that represent and maintain biodiversity.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"> </span>The results of the terrestrial selected scenarios show that, depending on the target scenario, an area between 17.3% and 46.4% of Korea's total terrestrial and inland water areas is needed to meet the set of pre-defined conservation targets while ensuring ecological representation of sites and features important for biodiversity.</p><p><strong><a href="http://wcmc.io/protectedplanetkorea">Download this report</a></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><img src="http://pp.new-web.pp-staging.linode.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/053/original/2435_Korea_Protected_Planet_Report2016_LOGOS.png" "=""></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2018</strong></p><p><strong>Protected Planet Report National Technical Series: France</strong><br></p><p><i>The Protected Planet France Report, led by the IUCN French Committee in collaboration with UNEP-WCMC, reviews the progress made by France with regards to protected areas in achieving global objectives and analyses their contribution to sustainable development. The Report mainly follows the definition of Aichi Target 11 and includes the following chapters: Spatial distribution of protected areas; Key Biodiversity Areas; Ecological Representation; Ecological Connectivity; Management Effectiveness; Equitable governance; Other effective area-based conservation measures; and Integration in the landscape and seascape.</i></p><p><i>By analysing the data contained in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), UNEP-WCMC contributed to the following sections of the Report: Maps and statistics on national PA coverage, including overseas territories, per designation type; Evolution of PA coverage in France since 1990, for terrestrial and marine areas; Overlay analysis between PAs and Key Biodiversity Areas for the terrestrial and marine realms; Representativeness of the PA network with regard to marine and terrestrial ecoregions; and Analysis of the connectivity of the French PA network, including transboundary PAs.</i></p>
