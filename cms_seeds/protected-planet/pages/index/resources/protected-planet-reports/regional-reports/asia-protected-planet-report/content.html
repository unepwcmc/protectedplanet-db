<p>Asia is the most populous region in the world, with a rich cultural and natural heritage. It includes <span>several megadiverse countries and is home to a number of global biodiversity “hotspots". For centuries, </span><span>protected areas have been an integral part of Asian landscapes and seascapes and have played a vital role in </span><span>conserving biodiversity and the ecosystem services on which many communities depend. However, rapid </span><span>economic development, population growth and an erosion of traditional practices are resulting in habitat </span><span>loss and degradation. This is putting protected areas in Asia at risk and leading to serious decline in the </span><span>biodiversity they harbour.</span></p><p>In 2010, governments from around the world, including all countries in Asia, committed to the Convention <span>on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity which sets 20 targets to be met by 2020 to conserve </span><span>biodiversity and ensure its sustainable and equitable use. These are known as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. </span><span>Aichi Target 11 focuses on protected areas, calling for the expansion of protected areas to encompass 17% </span><span>of terrestrial ecosystems and 10% of marine ecosystems to cover areas of importance for biodiversity and </span><span>ecosystem services. It also calls for the effective and equitable management of ecologically representative </span><span>and well-connected networks of protected areas, which are integrated into the wider landscape. These </span><span>targets and the principles they represent are critical to ensuring that protected areas will continue to deliver </span><span>on the objectives for which they were established.</span></p><div><strong>SCOPE</strong></div><p>This report, published in 2014, assesses progress towards the achievement of elements of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 in 24 <span>selected countries in East Asia, South Asia and South-east Asia. These are referred to as the “Asia Region" </span><span>throughout this report and are: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, </span><span>Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, </span><span>Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, </span><span>Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam.</span></p><p><b><a href="http://www.unep-wcmc.org/system/dataset_file_fields/files/000/000/264/original/Asia_Protected_Planet_WEB.pdf?1415613854">Download the Asia Protected Planet Report</a></b></p>
