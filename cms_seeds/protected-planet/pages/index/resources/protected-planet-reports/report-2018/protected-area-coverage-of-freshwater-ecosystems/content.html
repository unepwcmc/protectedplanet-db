<div> <div> <p><span>Freshwater is of vital importance for the survival of all life on Earth. Freshwater ecosystems occupy less than </span><span>1% of the earth's surfaces, but could possibly contain as much as 12% of all known species (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2014). However, around 64-71% of global wetlands extent has been lost in the past century (Davidson, 2014), and freshwater species are among the most threatened on earth (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2014).</span></p><p>Protected area coverage of freshwater ecosystems globally is estimated to range between 11-21%, depending on which methodology and freshwater dataset are used. For example, an analysis of protected area coverage of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs included in the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD; Lehner and Döll, 2004), showed that globally 20.7% of freshwater ecosystems were within protected areas (Juffe-Bignoli et al., 2014). However in 2017, another global analysis of protected areas with IUCN Category I–VI and Ramsar sites concluded that about 89% of these were unprotected.
