<div> <div> <div> <p><span>Beyond protecting biodiversity, protected areas can contribute to maintaining or enhancing the supply of ecosystem services. At the global level, forest protected areas have been shown to provide a substantial proportion of the drinking water for one-third of the world's 100 largest cities (Dudley and Stolton, 2003) and more than 1.1 billion people depend on forest protected areas for a significant part of their livelihoods (Mulongoy and Gidda, 2008). Regarding carbon, terrestrial protected areas account for approximately 20% of the carbon sequestered by all land ecosystems (Melillo et al., 2016).</span><br></p><p>Marine protected areas are also of vital importance for the delivery of ecosystem services, including for tourism, fisheries and coastal protection. As highlighted at the UN Oceans Conference (2018), marine protected areas contribute substantially to social, economic and environmental benefits including through food security, livelihood security, poverty alleviation, disaster-risk reduction and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Specifically, corals and mangroves provide a number of valuable services to local communities across the world but not <span>all of them are within protected areas. For instance, globally, 28.6% of coral reef fisheries biomass, 20.4% of coral reef coastal protection (US$), and 44.3% of coral reef tourism value (US$) lies within protected areas (see Figure below for an example). Similarly, protected areas contribute 31% of mangrove fisher catch and 35.7% of mangrove above-ground biomass. These areas that supply important ecosystem services should therefore be prioritized for protection.</span></p><p><img src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/172/original/PPLIVE2018_Box4_fg1.png" alt="Pplive2018 Box4 Fg1"></p><p><img src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/173/original/PPLIVE2018_Box4_fg2.png" alt="Pplive2018 Box4 Fg2"></p><p><span> <b><i><strong>Example of marine ecosystem services coral coastal protection (A) and co</strong><strong>ral fisheries (B) and their location in relation to protected areas in south Sulawesi, Indonesia.</strong></i></b></span></p><p>Source: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN. 2018a.
