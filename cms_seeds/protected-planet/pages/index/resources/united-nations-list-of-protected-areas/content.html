	The United Nations List of Protected Areas is a compilation of all designated protected areas in the world. There have been fourteen edition since the publication of the first edition in 1961/62. The List, based upon <a href="http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/207606/E_RES_714(XXVII)-EN.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">Resolution 173 (XXVII)</a> of the 1959 session of the UN Economic and Social Council,  represents a testimony to the great political commitment that countries have shown towards this global conservation priority. The list has undergone several names changes from the "UN List of National Parks and Equivalent Reserves" to the "UN List on National Parks and Protected Areas" to from 2003 the "UN List of Protected Areas"

	<span>Since its inception the publication of the UN List has generated a lot of interest and has been a catalyst in the expansion of many countries' protected area networks through the development of new national legislative measures (IUCN 1971). This expansion in numbers and coverage of the protected area networks of countries apparent throughout the successive editions of the UN List is illustrative of an increased recognition by Governments and others of the need to conserve the Earth's natural places, and more recently of the need to move towards a more sustainable management and use of biodiversity and ecosystem services. <br>
