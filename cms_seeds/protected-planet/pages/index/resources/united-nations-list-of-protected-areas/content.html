The List, based upon <a href="http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/207606/E_RES_714(XXVII)-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y">Resolution 173 (XXVII)</a> of the 1959 session of the UN Economic and Social Council,  represents a testimony to the great political commitment that countries have shown towards this global conservation priority. The list has undergone several names changes from the "UN List of National Parks and Equivalent Reserves" to the "UN List on National Parks and Protected Areas" to from 2003 the "UN List of Protected Areas"

	Since its inception the publication of the UN List has generated a lot of interest and has been a catalyst in the expansion of many countries' protected area networks through the development of new national legislative measures (IUCN 1971). This expansion in numbers and coverage of the protected area networks of countries apparent throughout the successive editions of the UN List is illustrative of an increased recognition by Governments and others of the need to conserve the Earth's natural places, and more recently of the need to move towards a more sustainable management and use of biodiversity and ecosystem services. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>United Nations List of Protected Areas 2018</strong><br></p><p>The 2018 edition of the UN List contains 238,563 protected areas covering an area of 46,414,431 km<sup>2</sup>. The publication reviews progress since 2014. In those four years protected areas have expanded across both terrestrial and marine environments, with coverage under protection in the marine realm more than doubling in size. About 30,000 protected areas have been added representing an area equivalent to the area set aside for protection during the preceding ten years by the addition of 100,000 protected areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/155/original/UN_List_2018_ES_EN.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [English]</a></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/156/original/UN_List_2018_ES_FR.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [French]</a><br></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/157/original/UN_List_2018_ES_ES.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [Spanish]</a><br></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/158/original/UN_List_2018_ES_RU.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [Russian]</a></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/159/original/UN_List_2018_ES_AR.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [Arabic]</a></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/160/original/UN_List_2018_ES_CH.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [Chinese]</a></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/161/original/UN_List_2018_ES_PO.docx" target="_blank">UN List 2018 Executive Summary [Portuguese]</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>United Nations List of Protected Areas 2014</strong><br></p><p>The 2014 United Nations List of Protected Areas is a compilation of all designated protected areas in the world.

This definitive list is arranged by country and classified by management aims, ranging from strict protection to protected areas managed for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems. Many protected areas designated by national authorities are also recognised for their international importance under global or regional conventions and programmes. Currently, there are some 891 Ramsar wetlands, 114 World Heritage sites, 352 biosphere reserves and 1,470 special protection areas, all of which are recorded in the 1997 UN list</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://wcmc.io/UN_List_of_PAs_1997" class="is-external">Download United Nations List of Protected Areas 1997</a></p><p>
