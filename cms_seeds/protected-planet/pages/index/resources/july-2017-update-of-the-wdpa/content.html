Highlights:
Sweden: Update of two Natura 2000 sites in Northern Sweden, Torne och Kalix älvsystem and Piteälven, both sites are river networks.

United Kingdom:Partial update of protected areas, including the addition of 117 privately protected areas in Scotland. These protected areas have been added as the result of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) project, Putting Nature on the Map, which aims to capture the full range of protected areas in the UK

Antarctica/ Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction: Partial update, resulting in the inclusion of five proposed records composing the Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area. The site has been proposed by the Commission for the Convention on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and will become a designated protected area of around 2 million km2 in December 2017.
