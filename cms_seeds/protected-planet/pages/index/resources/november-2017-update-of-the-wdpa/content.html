European Environment Agency (EEA) Common Database on Designated Areas ( CDDA) – Complete update of 45 countries resulting in the net addition of 1,491 records. Major changes to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) occured in Norway and Portugal. In Norway, an area of over 700 km² was added to the country's MPA network. In Portugal, an area of over 135,000 km² was added, including the Arquipélago Submarino do Meteor Resource Management Protected Area.

Bahamas: Complete update involving the addition of 20 new polygons, updated boundaries for a further 31 polygons, and removal of 24 points. This update resulted from the alignment of data in the WDPA with Caribnode, a portal hosted by The Nature Conservancy. New and existing records were validated and quality checked by the Bahamas National Trust.

Togo: Complete update of the protected area network for Togo.

Ramsar Sites, Wetlands of International Importance: Addition of new Ramsar sites for Brazil, Italy, France and Samoa as well as update of 2 site boundaries for Togo and the conversion of a point to a polygon fro the Bahamas. This update is part of a series of updates on Ramsar data within the WDPA, resulting from enhanced data flows between UNEP-WCMC, the Ramsar Secretariat and member states.
