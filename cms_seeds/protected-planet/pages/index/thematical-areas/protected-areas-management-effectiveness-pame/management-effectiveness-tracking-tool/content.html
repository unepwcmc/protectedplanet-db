<p>
	First published in 2002, the METT was one of the first tools developed to reflect the IUCN WCPA framework for protected area management effectiveness. Since then it has become one of the most used PAME tools across the globe; by 2016 it had been applied in over a fifth of the world's terrestrial protected areas.
	<br>
	<br>
	The METT consists of two sections:
</p><ol>
	<li><strong>Datasheets</strong> that collect key information on the protected area, its characteristics, threats and management objectives and details of who carried out the assessment</li>
	<li><span></span>An <strong>assessment form</strong> that provides a composite measurement across 30 parameters integrating all six components of the WCPA Framework. The form is designed around a questionnaire with four alternative responses, each with an associated score ranging between 0 (poor) to 3 (excellent). Each question also has data fields to include notes about the answers (with justification if possible) and steps to be taken to improve management if necessary.</li>
</ol><p>
	The METT was originally developed by the World Bank/WWF Alliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use; as experience in using the tool has been gained there has been several versions of the METT and many adaptations.
</p><p>
	Any practitioners planning to implement the METT should refer to the handbook developed by the authors of the METT which provides:
</p><ol>
	<li>best practice advice on implementation,</li>
	<li><span></span>question by question guidance on the datasheets and assessment form,</li>
	<li><span></span>a discussion of how the METT can contribute to improved protected areas,</li>
	<li><span></span>a history the METT's development and use of the METT and</li>
	<li><span></span>details of METT implementation and adaption.</li>
