<p>Large natural areas are increasingly isolated, within a matrix of human-dominated landscapes and seascapes. This isolation affects the movement of species and the flow of ecological processes necessary for the provision of ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. <strong>Connectivity</strong> is a concept that recognizes that habitats and species function best as part of a large, interconnected network that is maintained and protected for nature by involving people. Therefore connections to the wider semi-natural and natural landscapes are an essential feature for many protected areas.<o:p></o:p><br></p><p><strong>UN Environment's Connectivity Conservation Project</strong></p><p>UN Environment have recently committed to the development of a Connectivity Conservation Strategy. This strategy will assist countries and regions to integrate connectivity considerations into national land-use and seascape planning processes in line with their commitments towards the achievement of the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, notably Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 11, 12, 14 and 15. </p><p>To achieve this, UNEP-WCMC seeks to work in partnership with experts and build upon on-going connectivity conservation work to promote an understanding of the priorities for connectivity and provide guidance to scale-up the use of connectivity as a conservation tool. To find out more about the project's objectives, go to the Section <a href="/c/connectivity-conservation/overview-of-unep-led-initiative">Project Overview</a>.<u></u></p><p><strong>Draft IUCN Guidelines on 'Areas of Connectivity Conservation'</strong></p><p>In May 2016, the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas released <a href="http://wcmc.io/ACC_DraftGuidelines">Draft Guidelines</a> for defining Areas of Connectivity Conservation (ACCs) for comment and feedback. The draft Guidelines also recognise different types of ACCs, present selection criteria for identifying these area, and describe the governance of ACCs. The Final Guidelines will assist with the recognition and spatial delineation of ACCs globally. </p><p>IUCN WCPA is seeking written comments on these <a href="http://wcmc.io/ACC_DraftGuidelines">Draft Guidelines</a> as a basis for their improvement and finalisation. Written comments can be sent to Dr Graeme L. Worboys (<a href="mailto:g.worboys@bigpond.com">g.worboys@bigpond.com</a>). Final date for the receipt of written comments: <strong>1st September 2017</strong>. </p><p><br><u></u></p>
