<p>Biodiversity and ecosystem services are distributed globally and extend beyond geopolitical boundaries. As a result there is growing recognition of the need for connected conservation areas that provide a fundamental contribution to maintaining the ecological integrity of protected areas and the habitats and species they conserve. These areas exist across terrestrial areas; in air space as air migratory routes (flyways); along and within freshwater rivers; across lakes and estuaries; and in marine environments.</p><p>The project is divided into three phases:</p><h4>Phase 1: Creation of global information hub</h4><p>The project will collate information on existing connectivity conservation initiatives at varying scales into a global information hub containing:</p><p>A Global Connectivity Conservation Database, comprising of basic attributes including spatial information on known connectivity initiatives but will be linked to the World Database on Protected Areas.</p><p>A map of connectivity conservation areas that will inform a global analysis of potential areas for scaling up connectivity conservation at the landscape and seascape scale.</p><p>A resource library holding information on methods for modelling connectivity; case studies and best practice in connectivity conservation management; and policy and legal instruments.</p><h4>Phase 2: Analysis and development of practical guidelines</h4><p>The global information hub will be used to:</p><p>Analyse relevant policies, legislation and instruments.</p><p>Produce practical guidance material to support the recognition, <span>establishment, and implementation of connectivity conservation areas </span><span>to conserve large, functioning ecological landscapes and seascapes.</span></p><h4>Phase 3: Scale up implementation</h4><p>Working in collaboration and building on existing efforts, this initiative <span>will provide:</span></p><p>Technical support for decision makers and other stakeholders in <span>priority areas to establish connectivity conservation areas.</span></p><p>Capacity building for decision makers and stakeholders in pilot sites to <span>facilitate the management of connectivity conservation areas.</span></p><p><span><strong>For contact information please email nina.bhola@unep-wcmc.org</strong></span></p><p><br></p>
