<p>
	Aichi Target 11 on protected and conserved areas is one of the 20 targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This plan provides an overarching framework for the conservation of biodiversity and guides implementation by state parties. Target 11 aspires 'By 2020, 
	<a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-2" target="_blank">at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas</a>, especially <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-3" target="_blank">areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services</a>, are conserved through <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-5" target="_blank">effectively</a> and <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-6" target="_blank">equitably managed</a>, <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-4" target="_blank">ecologically representative</a> and <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-7" target="_blank">well-connected systems</a> of protected areas and <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-8" target="_blank">other effective area-based conservation measures</a>, and <a href="https://livereport.protectedplanet.net/chapter-8" target="_blank">integrated into the wider landscape and seascape</a>'.

<p>
	Less than two years away from the end of the Strategic Plan, further concerted efforts are required to reach some elements of the target by 2020.
</p>
<h2 id="partnership">What is the Partnership?</h2>
<p>
	In recognition of the important work that remains to be done by 2020, the Global Partnership on Aichi Target 11 was formed to facilitate the achievement of the target. It provides a platform for all parties and partners to express their intent and reiterate their commitments towards achieving the target. The Partnership also seeks to align global, regional and national implementation of priority actions in a coordinated manner among all relevant stakeholders and rightsholders.
</p>
<p>
	The partnership is composed of a large number of coordination agencies and sub-regional implementation networks, each operating with different roles and responsibilities, to ensure a coordinated and effective implementation of actions to reach the target by 2020.
</p>
<h2 id="commitment">How to make a commitment?</h2>
<p>
	Everyone is encouraged to contribute and make a commitment that would serve to contribute to one or more elements of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11.

<h2 id="tracking">How will the commitments be tracked?</h2>
<p>
	Commitments made by parties, partners and individuals are part of a concerted effort to achieve the target in recognition of the importance of protected areas as a tool for conserving biodiversity and to acknowledge efforts made by the protected area community to make these areas work.
