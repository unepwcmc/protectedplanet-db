<p> World Heritage sites are places on earth that are of <a href="http://biodiversitya-z.org/content/outstanding-universal-value-ouv" target="_blank" title="http://biodiversitya-z.org/content/outstanding-universal-value-ouv">Outstanding Universal Value (OUV)</a> to humanity and therefore, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations. Places as diverse and unique as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, Galapagos Islands in Ecuador and the Grand Canyon in the USA are examples of places inscribed on the World Heritage List. The <a href="http://biodiversitya-z.org/content/world-heritage-convention-whc" target="_blank" title="http://biodiversitya-z.org/content/world-heritage-convention-whc">World Heritage Convention</a>, which has been ratified by 191 countries, was adopted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972, and came into force in 1975, for the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the world cultural and natural heritage. Under this international legal instrument, sites are nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List, either for their natural or cultural values, or a mixture of the two. The secretariat to the World Heritage Convention is the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, whilst three organisations: International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) act as its Advisory Bodies. The Advisory Body on natural heritage is IUCN. </p><p> For more information check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/world-heritage-sites-whs">World Heritage Sites page</a> on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/">Biodiversity A to Z</a> </p><p> The World Heritage Convention <a target="_blank" href="http://whc.unesco.org/">home page</a> has more detailed information. </p> <h2>World Heritage Sites in the WDPA<br> </h2> <p> To see a list of all World Heritage Sites sites in the WDPA click <a href="https://protectedplanet.net/search?designation=World+Heritage+Site+(natural+or+mixed)">here</a>. </p><p> <img src="http://stage.protectedplanet.net/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/024/original/site_0487_0001ver2.jpg"> </p><p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/henderson-island-world-heritage-site">Henderson Island World Heritage Site</a> Â©UNESCO </p><p> For more information on this site please visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/487">Henderson Island UNESCO World Heritage Centre web page</a> </p>
