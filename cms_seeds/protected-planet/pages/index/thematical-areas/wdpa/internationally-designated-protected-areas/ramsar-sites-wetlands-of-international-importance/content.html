	 Ramsar sites are wetlands considered to be of international importance. The international convention which forms the basis for their identification is commonly referred to as the "Ramsar Convention" after the city in Iran where the convention was signed in 1971. The Convention is an international treaty for the conservation and wise use of wetlands. All joining Parties of the Ramsar Convention commit themselves to work towards the “three pillars" of the Convention:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ensuring the conservation and wise use of wetlands it has designated as Wetlands of International Importance, </li>
	<li>Including as far as possible the wise use of all wetlands in national environmental planning, and</li>
	<li>Consulting with other Parties about implementation of the Convention, especially in regard to transboundary wetlands, shared water systems, and shared species.</li>
</ol>
