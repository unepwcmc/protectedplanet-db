	 Biosphere reserves are areas of terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems, internationally recognized under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme, which innovate and demonstrate approaches to conservation and sustainable development. Biosphere Reserves are intended to promote a balanced relationship between people and nature. They are nominated by national governments, and are recognised under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme, and remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the States where they are situated.
