[text summary]
Equity relates to how fairly a protected area is managed: who has a say in decisions, how decisions are taken, and how the costs and benefits are shared.


[text introduction]
The requirement for protected areas to be equitable is written into international agreements, including Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The importance of equity in protected areas is underlined by the fact that benefits from protected areas are often experienced at multiple scales, including the global scale, whereas the costs are primarily shouldered by local people.

<p>At the bottom of this page you can explore results based on the indicators developed by <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.05.014">Zafra-Calvo et al (2017)</a></strong> for a sample of protected areas.
</p>
<p><strong>If you are familiar with any of these protected areas, and would like to provide an additional perspective on their level of equity, we encourage you to complete this questionnaire (<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/V15oXxRBscpjoupy1">https://goo.gl/forms/V15oXxRBscpjoupy1</a>). </strong>
</p>
<p>Responses submitted will be managed by the TRECKQUITY project (University of Copenhagen). Results from survey responses will not be immediately displayed on the Protected Planet website, but may be displayed, published or used for analyses in the future.
</p>
<p>The scores presented here correspond to the answers provided to ten questions in a multiple-choice questionnaire. Each of these questions was presented with three multiple-choice answers, resulting in a score of <strong>1</strong> (<i>the protected area does not score highly on this indicator: the management does not enhance this aspect of social equity in the protected area</i>), <strong>2</strong> (<i>the protected area has a medium score for this indicator: the management somewhat enhances this aspect of social equity in the protected area</i>) or <strong>3</strong> (<em><i>the protected area scores highly on this indicator: the management strongly enhances this aspect of social equity in the protected area</i></em>).
</p>
<p>This rapid assessment is designed to be undertaken at the level of individual protected areas. The assessment can act as a starting point in encouraging further discussions around the different elements of social equity. Areas for particular attention could be identified based on lower-scoring elements of equity, or on elements that different stakeholders have divergent opinions on.
</p>
<p>Users of the rapid assessment are also strongly encouraged to combine such discussions with more open-ended, long-term participatory processes. These processes could include surveying local stakeholder groups with diverse values, as well as developing a disaggregated analysis of social equity perceptions and views among different stakeholder groups. Such processes can help to inform specific actions to improve social equity in a given protected area.
